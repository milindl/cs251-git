\section{Review 1: OMG - Oh My God}

Stars: $\frac{4}{5}$



OMG! is a full on entertainer which is exciting, with loads of funny moments. The screenplay of the story - inspired by a Gujarati play is written by Umesh Shukla - is brilliant. The screenplay is fast and direction is good. The dialogs are top-notch.

Akshay Kumar as Lord Krishna is charming and affable. Paresh rawal acts with so ease and confidence. He is the main protagonist and does full justice to the role. Mithun Chakrabothy is really funny and so is Govind Namdeo. Applause to a well deserved cast.


\section{Review 2: 3 Idiots}

I loved this movie, it was a very smart and enjoyable movie despite the length. I loved the characters specially Rancho, Pro Virus and Silencer. It starts a bit slow... but you have to be patient. First half is good, second half is awesome!

Although much of the story is very predictable, I believe the film was supposed to be this way, as the point of the film was to teach the audience a very important lesson: do what you love to do. As with all Indian films, this one also had the token `love' part, which no Indian movie seems to be able to function without.

\section{Another Review}

I don't actually watch movies so this is immaterial/
